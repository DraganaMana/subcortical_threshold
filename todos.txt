- Get the sub06run01, parcel it in cortical (7N400ROI) and subcortical regions
- Plot the timeseries per ROI (start with subcort), and per network too
- Match the metadata times of the different SNR sound onsets to the times in the fMRI run
- Match the metadata times of the hears & not heard trials

- I should use scans that don't have the heart and breathing regressed out ?
Answer: No it's okay that they're regressed out

- Also I should remove trials based on framewise displacement check

# Notes from papers etc 

From Seltzer et al 2022
- The scans should not be spatially smoothened [they're not]
- The segmentation should be in original subject space,
and in the same space we can segment the thalamus
- The fMRI signal was linearly interpolated to 4 times the sampling 
in order to better match it with the arousal events
- Arousal windows with more than 0.3mm framewise displacement are excluded
- The signal was baseline corrected -10 to -7 sec before arousal


Meeting with Bev : 
- fSL or freesurfer combination of the masks left and right thalamus 
 -- 
 - look at the framewise displacement and the global signal changes and see how much the 
 global signal changes with the framewise displacement 
 - retroicor regression of the heart and breathing - based on the frequencies of the two signals
 or HRAN to regress
